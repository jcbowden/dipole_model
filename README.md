# dipole_model

Modelling the interaction of collagen protein dipoles with polarise IR light. 3D interactive collagen dipole distribution outputing dot products of incoming IR light polarisation with angle of dipole in a distribution. Cycles through varying angles and distributions of collagen fibre arrangements and angle of incoming IR radiation polarisation.

Written as a side project for my work at QUT which was looking at MRI and biochemical analysis of cartilage.
